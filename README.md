## About Me

🧑‍⚕️ 👨‍🏫 I'm a former care worker and maths teacher currently starting a new career in Software Development.
⛰️ I spend a huge amount of my time in the Scottish Highlands, 🧗 rock climbing, 🏃 running and 🚵‍♂️ mountain biking.

## Languages and tools

#### C#, Java, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, React, Svelte, Express, Node, MongoDB, Socket.io, LayerCake

- 🧮 I have a degree in Maths and Philosophy. I studied Coding, Cryptography, Information Theory, Game Theory and Foundational Logic.
- 💬 I'd love feedback on the projects I'm developing, feel free to get in touch, or to create your own improvements.

## Projects

### Witter

https://github.com/treasurewild/Witter

Witter is a simple mock of Twitter, using a MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js stack. I'm adding more functionality as I learn.

### Traffic Lights

https://github.com/treasurewild/Traffic-Lights

This is a simple feedback tool for remote class teaching. It allows teachers to ask plenary questions in real-time and retrieve feedback from pupils, allowing a teacher to gauge understanding and progress to inform their teaching. Lessons and questions can be created as templates, or they could be done on the fly, with responses from pupils given anonymously.

### Sole Seduction

https://github.com/treasurewild/sole-seduction

I worked collaboratively on this project with some colleagues from my bootcamp. We created an eCommerce shoe shop that would display products and allow a user to filter by colour, gender and brand. The key thing I wanted to learn from this was about working as part of a remote team, sharing code and managing our objectives, and I'm really pleased with the result. We used React, Express, Node and MongoDB to create this site.

### UK Weather History

https://github.com/treasurewild/UK-Weather-History

This project is still very much a work in progress. It builds on a resource I developed as a maths teacher, allowing pupils to work collaboratively with a large and meaningful dataset at GCSE level. It grabs data from weather stations around the UK (available as .txt files from the Met Office), then parses this data to provide graphs showing the changes in rainfall, sunshine and temperature. When it's finished teachers will be able to select a weather station near their school and print customised worksheets to allow a class to create a giant time series graph, and then also calculate the moving point average. It will also create interactive graphs so that teachers can talk meaningfully about the changes over time. It's developed using Svelte and LayerCake.
