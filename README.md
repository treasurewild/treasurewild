👋 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 Shwmae!

🧑‍⚕️ 👨‍🏫 I'm a former care worker and maths teacher looking for a new challenge.

- 🥋 I’m proficient in C#.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and more.
- 🧮 I have a degree in Maths and Philosophy. I studied Coding, Cryptography, Information Theory, Game Theory and Foundation Logic.
- 💬 I’m new to full stack development and I'd love feedback on the projects I'm developing while I learn.

⛰️ I spend a huge amount of my time in the Scottish Highlands, 🧗 rock climbing, 🏃 running and 🚵‍♂️ mountain biking.
